If you are reading this, you want to know how to find things I suppose?
In Town, in the shopping District, there'll be a whole new menu option which should be: Mystic Gallery Brothel.

Go there, choose the location, or Stella, you want to view monsters from. More locations become available as you complete more locations...
And I get around to coding them into the different menu options that would otherwise appear as I get to them.
